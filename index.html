        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p> 
            My name is Jon. I am 29 years of age. I was born and raised in California. I currently work as a cook in south american cousine and 
            am taking the a fullstack web development bootcamp through edx. I will finish the bootcamp in th beginning of September, a week or so 
            after my 30th birthday. Something I find interesting about myself is that I bought a one way ticket to the Amazon shortly after 
            high school. I went alone and with only 500 dollars in pocket, and no phone. I ended up staying for 3 years. I don't know who I'd be
            if I didn't have that life experience.
